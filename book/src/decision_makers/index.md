# Decision makers

In [previous chapter](../first_steps.md) we have seen use of the __FSM__ (Finite
State Machines). FSM is just one of many AI engines called decision makers
(a.k.a. AI systems).

Decision makers only job is to do what their name suggest - make a decision about
what agent should do. They usually contain a set of states/actions with rules to
possible transitions, what differentiate one from another is how these transitions
are resolved.

In next chapters we will take a look at decision makers used in the industry and
explain how they work, what are their pros and cons and what to use them for.
