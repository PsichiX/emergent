# Typical use cases

- __Emergent AI behaviors__

  Best example of the game that uses Utility AI is __The Sims__. You can basically
  create a set of actions agent can do depending on its current needs and let
  agent chose what's best for him to do at given time by modeling behavior after
  __Maslow's hierarchy of needs__.

  Rouglike games can use it to make procedurally generated agents perform unique
  life-cycles based on PCG agent stats.

  Strategy games can use it to let factions and units evaluate certain strategies
  that will then be run by other decision makers (using hierarchical approach).

- __Branchless dynamic dialogues__

  You can bring life to dialogues with NPCs by making NPC choose a line that fits
  best current situation and facts about the world. Imagine talking with NPC
  before and after result of some major game event or some crazy fact heard about
  one of your battles and using that knowledge to drop some comment about it or
  ask you questions about what happened.

- __Emergent storytelling and adaptive world events__

  When making a game focused on replayability your goal is to make player
  experience the game differently on each playthrough, for that you might want
  to forget about scripted events sequence and let game spawn game events that
  based on the game state or even player "fun" score to keep pacing that will
  make player engaged.

In general you can use Utility AI to systems that are meant to be unpredictable,
provide unique experience to the player or even produce viral moments for players
to share with others.
