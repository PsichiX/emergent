# Introduction

The goal of this book is to introduce readers to wonders of game AI development,
explaining how certain AI techniques work, which of them are best suited for what
usecases and more than everything: to show that AI for games only sounds
intimidating and in reality we all have born with intuition on how to build AI
systems for games.

Although we will cover many AI techniques used in industry, we will be focusing
mostly on ones that lead to producing emergent gameplay, a branch of games AI
that is getting more and more popular.

Also note that while this book is gonna explain AI techniques for games, all
examples and demos will be written in Rust programming language, and sometimes
they will be using [__emergent__](https://github.com/PsichiX/emergent) crate.
